Introduction

The implementation processes and systems of cybersecurity 
is often noticed to be insufficient in ensuring that the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Authenticity (CIAA)
of information is achieved. For this, 
the processes and techniques of digital forensic are often required to investigate
potential security issues and digital crimes if the CIAA is surpassed. 
If it carefully rebuilted, may assist in
developing a security strategy that can be used in stronging
systems. though, digital forensics as made
by a team of researchers in 2001 was presented as ‘‘the
use of scientifically derived and vindicated methods toward the
preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis,
interpretation, documentation, and presentation of digital
record derived from digital sources to facilitate or further
the rebuilted of events found to be criminal or helping
to relate disallowed actions shown to be disruptive to planned operations’’.
